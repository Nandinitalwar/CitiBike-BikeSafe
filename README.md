Bike theft is making CitiBike unsafe for users. In 2016, There was nearly a 60% increase in theft of CitiBikes NYC-wide, with a 100% jump in Manhattan. 
This repository contains two files on Bike Safe, namely the .py code that would connect the IoT lock (Arduino) to CitiBike's server and .ino code that runs the IoT lock on Arduino. It also contains elementary code in Ruby, on how long it would take to get to the destination just by entering the end destination.
